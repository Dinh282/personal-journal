# Personal Journal

## Description

The Personal Journal app is designed with the user in mind to make an easier experience for those who love to journal. You can make multiple different journals with a click of a button. One to vent about frustrations with work, one to write down all those ideas and/or one to help empty the mind after a challenging day. Once you sign in and make an account, all of your journals and individual entries will be saved and kept in one place for you to see at any time. You can also delete a journal or entry if you'd please and see them displayed with turn.js in your own online notebook.

## Instructions

1. Go to the website and click sign up to create a new account.
2. Fill in an email and a secure password along with your first and last name to give the account profile some information.
3. Once you've created an account then you'll be brought to the dashboard where you can scroll through your current journals or create a new one.
4. Once you've created a new journal, you can then create a new entry with a title and start writing like you would normally.
5. The Jounral and the entries themselves will be saved within your profile and you will be able to come back and edit, delete or create a new entry at any time.
6. You can make as many journals as you want and just remember, while typing may not have the same feel as writing, it allows you to epmty your mind much faster!
