<h2 class="text-center mt-5">We'll have a Create New Jounral button for the user
    to click on to create a new journal. When they click on it, it should take them to
    /journals/new which would render a form to fill out for their journal title and description.
    The HTML code for this page goes inside journals.handlebars. We should also include
     &lt;script&gt; src="/js/script.js" async&gt;&lt;/script&lt; to link a script file to handle 
     requesting for the list of available journals data so that we can inject it into the template(journals.handlebars).
